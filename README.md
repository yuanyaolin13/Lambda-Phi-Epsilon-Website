# Lambda Phi Epsilon Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for UNC Lambda Phi Epsilon's official website! This repository contains the source code for the website, and should be updated every semester as the organization grows. Visit the live website at [unclambdas.org](https://unclambdas.org/).

This repository is a revamp of our [old website](https://github.com/yuanyaolin13/unclambdasweb), converting outdated HTML/CSS into a modern React/TailwindCSS app.
